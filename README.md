This is a derivative work of AtomicStryker's Dynamic Lights Minecraft Mod.  LakMoore orignally took AtomicStryker's work and butchered it a little until it did exactly the same work in a slightly less intelligent way.

LakMoore then spent hours and hours re-working Entity Lights in many different and varied ways until he settled on this one, which he quite liked and is suitably different from the original code to warrant a separate, forked Mod.

YMMV
